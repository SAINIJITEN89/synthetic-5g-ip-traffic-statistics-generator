## Detailed Guideline: Fast Synthetic 5G Traffic Stats Simulation with Claude Code on Linux (8 Cores, No GPU)

Here’s a comprehensive step-by-step guideline for building a **high-performance synthetic 5G traffic statistics generator** using Claude code. The strategy is designed specifically for a multicore Linux server, aiming to minimize end-to-end execution time—from seconds to, at most, a few minutes even for large scenarios. You’ll retain **interval duration**, **number of users**, and **bandwidth per user** as configuration options.

### 1. Key Performance Principles

- **Minimize Python for-loops:** Exploit vectorized operations (NumPy, pandas) over explicit iteration for all per-user/interval stats.
- **Batch and precompute:** Apply all overlays (time, event, traffic mix), random draws, and impairment models in arrays/batches.
- **Multi-core parallelism:** Use Python multiprocessing (`ProcessPoolExecutor` or `joblib`) to simulate independent intervals/scenarios in parallel across 8 cores.
- **Avoid unnecessary logging, validation, and I/O in main loops:** Move checks and logs outside the main simulation path.
- **Optimize data export:** Collect all statistics first, then export (as DataFrame/CSV/JSON) in one or few “bulk” operations.


### 2. Project/Code Structure

#### (A) Project Organization

- `config.yaml` (user parameters; interval, user count, bandwidth/user, traffic profiles, overlays)
- `trafficgen.py` (main logic)
- `profiles.py` (profile/model utilities)
- `impairments.py` (latency, loss, jitter overlay)
- `multiproc_utils.py` (multiprocessing utils, if needed)
- `output_writer.py` (efficient export)
- `run.sh` (shell wrapper for Linux)


#### (B) Python Libraries

- `numpy` and `pandas` (vectorized, in-memory stats)
- `concurrent.futures` for multiprocessing
- `pyyaml` or `argparse` for easy configuration


### 3. Parameterization

Your `config.yaml` or CLI flags should enable users to set:

- `interval_ms`: Reporting interval, e.g., 100, 1000, 60000ms.
- `num_users`: Total simulated users.
- `bandwidth_per_user_mbps`: For per-user or per-profile rates.
- Duration, traffic mix, overlays, impairment models.

Use schema validation (once, at startup) to guard against errors.

### 4. Fast Logic Patterns

#### Vectorized Batch Counter Generation

- Prepare arrays for interval timestamps of shape (num_intervals,).
- For each profile/class, create a `num_users` x `num_intervals` array of base stats (packets, bytes, etc.) using NumPy vector ops/rands.
- Compute overlays and impairments in arrays and apply multiplicatively or additively as needed.


#### Example (Pseudocode):

```python
import numpy as np

# Vectorized for 60 intervals, 10,000 users
interval_count = 60
num_users = 10000
base_bandwidth = 5_000_000 # bytes/sec/user

# Configurable overlays (shape: [intervals]):
timeofday_mult = np.array([...])
event_mult = np.array([...])
profiles = [{'share':0.85, 'size_dist':[1400, 200], ...}, ...]

# Generate all users' bytes per interval for profile 1:
bytes_matrix = (
    base_bandwidth 
    * timeofday_mult[None, :] # shape: [1, intervals]
    * event_mult[None, :]
    * np.random.normal(1.0, 0.05, (num_users, interval_count)) # small randomization
)
```


#### Precompute and Vectorize:

- Precompute per-interval overlays and impairments as arrays of shape (interval_count,).
- Slice or broadcast as needed per user and class.


#### Minimize Python Loops

- Only loop across traffic classes or aggregate short results. Don’t loop over users, intervals, or flows inside the simulation; maintain arrays for all of them at once.


#### Avoid Per-Row Logging/Validation

- Log warnings/validation errors before entering main simulation.
- Do not log/output each interval inside the main stat-generation loop.


### 5. Multi-core CPU Acceleration

Split the simulation:

- **By interval ranges** (easier, if intervals >> classes): chunk intervals, run stat generation for each chunk in a separate process.
- **By traffic class** (if per-class logic is complex): each core gets a class.
- **With joblib or concurrent.futures**—do not use threads (GIL-bound); use processes.


#### Example:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor

def gen_stats_for_chunk(chunk_args):
    # all data-generation logic for a chunk of intervals/classes
    return partial_results

with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=8) as pool:
    results = list(pool.map(gen_stats_for_chunk, chunks))
```


### 6. Intelligent Data Export

- Store all interval and user stats in-memory (as arrays or pandas DataFrames), write to disk in one or few `to_csv()` or `to_json()` calls after computation.
- **Avoid row-by-row file writing.**


### 7. Optional Further Optimizations

- Where fine details are unneeded, aggregate packets/users before random sampling—avoid per-packet modeling.
- Cache time-of-day, week, event overlays as NumPy arrays at script start.
- Use NumPy’s random generators, not Python’s, for performance.
- If the simulation gets truly massive, consider chunking and merging partial outputs.


### 8. Example CLI Usage \& Configuration

**config.yaml sample:**

```yaml
interval_ms: 1000
num_users: 15000
bandwidth_per_user_mbps: 2
duration_sec: 600
traffic_profiles: [...]
# overlays, impairments omitted for brevity
```

**run command:**

```bash
python3 trafficgen.py --config config.yaml
```

or

```bash
python3 trafficgen.py --interval 1000 --users 8000 --bw_user 3
```


### 9. Reference Implementation Snippets

- Vectorize all random draws for metrics.
- Use `ProcessPoolExecutor` or `joblib.Parallel` with `prefer="processes"`.
- Implement statistic computation in fast NumPy or pandas functions.
- Apply config validation prior to forking the main workers.


### 10. Recap: Checklist for Maximum Speed

- [x] Use NumPy/pandas for all stats/overlays, never Python loops for users/intervals.
- [x] Precompute overlays, chunk calculations for parallel execution (8 processes).
- [x] Minimize disk I/O; export once.
- [x] Validate configs before main run.
- [x] If the scenario grows, scale by further chunking and process-merging up to server RAM limits.


### 11. Useful Tools for Profiling (Optional)

- Use `cProfile` or `line_profiler` to identify any remaining slowdowns.
- Use `htop` or Linux `top` to monitor CPU core usage—ensure all 8 cores are busy during large runs.


#### With this approach, your synthetic 5G stat generator should efficiently handle large, realistic telecom scenarios in a fraction of the time—leveraging all modern CPU resources, and ready for rapid reconfiguration at any scale[^1][^2][^3].
